1) Local Municipal Manifestos
2) National Manifestos
A) Old Estate with Old HDB Flats
MacPherson is an old estate with lots of old ageing flats with an ageing population.
This is the place which will bear witness to the validity of my criticisms of PAP's FAILED Asset Enhancement Scheme.
PAP has asserted that Singaporeans can "Monetize" their HDB flats to finance their retirement. Residents in MacPherson will feel FIRST HAND the problems of such assertion made by PAP.
Majority of the HDB flats in MacPherson are at least 40 years to 55 years old. How much can they fetch?
There are not much intention of SERS in the estate, only Blk 81 to 83 had announced SERS recently. Besides, many of the flats have maintenance problems with leaking pipes and such.
HIP, VERS or SERS should be planned and carried out as soon as possible in MacPherson.
The HDB time bomb is ticking in MacPherson!
B) The Ageing Population
MacPherson will also bear witness to the criticisms of mine on the inadequate investment in Healthcare system catering to the elderly.
There is no Community Hospital providing care for common illness of the elderly.
There is plenty of land cleared in the area near the new MRT station but I bet, these would most probably sold to private developers to build Condos.
The government should build a Community Hospital in the the estate.
C) Poverty and Social Welfare Service
There is a group of vulnerable group of residents in MacPherson and I will invite charitable organizations to set up TCM Free Clinic and Soup Kitchen in the estate.
On top of that, Social Work services like counselling should also be in place.
The above is my Municipal Manifesto for MacPherson.
